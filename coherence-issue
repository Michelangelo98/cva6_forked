1)std_cache_subsystem, Test 18 FAILED

During the verification process for testing the compliance
with the memory model through litmus tests, it was necessary 
to use the master branch of the axi_riscv_atomics repository 
(https://github.com/pulp-platform/axi_riscv_atomics/tree/master).
However, when it is used, "Test 18" used to verify the correctness 
of the standard cache subsystem alone don't work. We didn't understand why.
Actually Test 18 isgit add  commented to avoid errors.

2)FPGA synthesis

Our utilizations reports use the SyncSpRamBeNx64.sv Vivado module instead
of the xpm_memory.sv because we observed it required half the BRAM
usage and was the same used by the CVA6 corinside the OpenPiton
platform.

3)Debug module during QuestaSim simulation

The debug module was detached from ariane instances inside
the ariane_testharnes module. It were stopping the execution
of litmus tests and restart them from the first instruction, 
generating errors. We didn't figured out what was the cause.
